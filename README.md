# Web Kundli - A Python Tool

Explore the internal mechanisms of a website: identify possible vulnerabilities, examine server setup, review security settings, and discover the technologies in use.

## Features
- Based on the details of each module, it calculates the percentage for that module and then determines the overall performance percentage across all modules. This data is used to display **Website Health** accordingly.
- The **NMAP scan feature** is also available. Reports can be generated with or without the NMAP scan to avoid network scanning.
- It supports **asynchronous programming**, allowing modules to run in parallel and achieve faster results.
- At present, the dashboard **supports 30 modules**. More features will be added soon!
